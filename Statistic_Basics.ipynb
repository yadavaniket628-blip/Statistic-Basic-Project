A positive correlation coefficient would indicate that as advertising spend increases, daily sales also tend to increase.

        "\n",
        "To understand the distribution of customer satisfaction survey data (on a scale of 1-10) before launching a new product, you can use a combination of summary statistics and visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Summary Statistics:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Mean:** The average satisfaction score. This gives you a single number representing the typical satisfaction level.\n",
        "*   **Median:** The middle satisfaction score when the data is ordered. This is useful if the data is skewed, as it's less affected by extreme scores than the mean.\n",
        "*   **Mode:** The most frequent satisfaction score. This tells you which score was given most often by customers.\n",
        "*   **Standard Deviation:** A measure of the spread or variability of the scores. A higher standard deviation indicates that the scores are more spread out from the mean, while a lower standard deviation indicates they are clustered closer to the mean.\n",
        "*   **Minimum and Maximum:** The lowest and highest scores in the dataset. This gives you the range of satisfaction levels.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Visualizations:**\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Histogram:** A histogram is an excellent way to visualize the distribution of numerical data. It shows the frequency of each score or range of scores, allowing you to see the shape of the distribution, identify the most common scores, and spot any potential outliers or unusual patterns.\n",
        "*   **Boxplot:** A boxplot can provide a quick summary of the distribution, including the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "By using these summary statistics and visualizations, you can gain a good understanding of how satisfied your customers are, identify any areas of concern, and make informed decisions before launching your new product."
